# Flight Price Prediction Tool

## Overview
This project aims to increase transparency in flight pricing and help consumers make informed decisions when booking flights. By analyzing the “Flight Price Prediction” dataset from Kaggle, collected via the octoparse tool from the “Ease My Trip” website between February 11, 2022, and March 31, 2022, we developed models that can be used to predict flight prices. Our analysis covers 300,261 distinct flight bookings, including details such as airline, flight code, departure and arrival cities, times, class, duration, and days until the flight. Our goal is to demystify flight pricing, aiding travelers in finding affordable prices and boosting their confidence in travel planning.

## Dataset
The dataset includes information on:
- Airline name
- Flight code
- Source and destination cities
- Departure and arrival times
- Number of stops
- Class (business or economy)
- Flight duration
- Days left until flight
- Ticket price

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: For all backend operations and data analysis.
- **Pandas and NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For developing predictive models.

## Project Workflow
1. **Setup**: Initial configuration, including library imports and dataset loading.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Cleaning the dataset to ensure accuracy for analysis.
3. **Descriptive Statistics**: Conducting statistical analysis to summarize the dataset's characteristics.
4. **Data Visualization and Notes**: Visualizing the data to identify patterns and noting key observations.
5. **Building the Models**: Developing models to predict flight prices.
6. **Testing and Improving the Models**: Evaluating and refining model performance.
7. **Using GridSearch to Optimize**: Optimizing model parameters for better accuracy.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
3. Run the cells in the main Jupyter notebook (`airData.ipynb`) to explore the dataset, model development, and optimization.
4. Follow the instructions within the notebook to use the predictive models and application.
